export const PROJECT_JAGUAR_CHAT = `Hey, can you help me summarize the latest updates on Project Jaguar?

We're finalizing the Jaguar architecture for the next prototype iteration, and I want to make sure I'm aligned before the design review. Specifically:
- How the new Jaguar airfoil design differs from the previous revision
- Any open risks in the Jaguar control system that engineering flagged last week
- Whether the Jaguar prototype timeline is still realistic given the latest test results

This is for internal planning only, but I want a concise breakdown I can share with the core Jaguar project team before tomorrow's meeting.`;
